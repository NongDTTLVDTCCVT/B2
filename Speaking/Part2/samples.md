# Speaking Part 2: Mẫu bài nói

**Situation:** You are planning a birthday party for your best friend. There are three options: *Going to a restaurant*, *Having a party at home*, and *Going for a picnic*. Which one is the best choice?

**Sample Answer:**

**Introduction:**
Well, I am thinking about a plan for my best friend's birthday party. Among three options: going to a restaurant, having a party at home, and going for a picnic, I believe that **having a party at home** is the best choice.

**Body Paragraph 1 (Why Home?):**
First of all, holding a party at home creates a cozy and intimate atmosphere. It allows us to talk freely and behave comfortably without bothering others. Secondly, it is much cheaper than going to a restaurant because we can buy ingredients and cook together, which is also a fun activity.

**Body Paragraph 2 (Why not Restaurant?):**
On the other hand, I don't choose going to a restaurant. Although the food might be delicious, it is usually very expensive. Also, restaurants can be noisy, making it hard to chat.

**Body Paragraph 3 (Why not Picnic?):**
As for going for a picnic, it highly depends on the weather. If it rains, the party will be ruined. Besides, preparing food and stuff for a picnic takes a lot of time and effort.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, because of the cozy atmosphere and reasonable cost, a home party is definitely the best decision.
