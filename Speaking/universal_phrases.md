Firstly, taking the train is a good idea because **it is affordable**. Unlike flying, train tickets are much cheaper, especially for a group of people.

Secondly, it is suitable for this situation because **the journey takes around 8 hours overnight**, which means we can sleep comfortably in the cabin and arrive fresh in the morning.

Lastly, it is convenient and useful because **we can enjoy the beautiful mountain scenery** along the way. This makes the trip more memorable.
