**Sample Answer:**

"Today I'm going to talk about the benefits of the Internet. People say that the Internet has changed our lives significantly. There are three main benefits: it is a huge source of information, a means of entertainment, and a tool for communication.

**First of all**, the Internet is an endless **source of information**. With just a click on Google, we can find answers to almost any question. It is very helpful for students to do research and for working people to update news.

**Secondly**, it provides various forms of **entertainment**. After a stressful day, we can listen to music, watch movies on Netflix, or play online games. It helps us relax and recharge our battery.

**Next**, logical communication has become much easier thanks to the Internet. We can keep in touch with family and friends via social networks like Facebook or Zalo, even if they live halfway across the world. Video calls make us feel like we are talking face-to-face.

**Personally, I also think that** the Internet helps us to work remotely. Many people can now work from home or earn money online, which saves travel time.

**In conclusion**, information, entertainment, communication, and working flexibility are the major advantages of the Internet."
