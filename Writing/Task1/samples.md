Hi Sarah,

How have you been? I hope everything is going well with you.

I'm writing to invite you to my 21st birthday party next Saturday evening at my place. We're having a small celebration with some close friends, and it wouldn't be the same without you there!

The party will start at 7 PM, and we've prepared plenty of pizza, drinks, and snacks. After dinner, we're planning to do some karaoke – I know you love singing! We might also play some board games if people are interested. The atmosphere will be very relaxed and casual, so just come as you are.

My apartment is at 123 Main Street, which is easy to reach by bus number 15. If you need directions or a ride, just let me know, and I can pick you up.

Please let me know by Thursday if you can make it so I can plan the food accordingly. I really hope you can come and celebrate with us!

Looking forward to seeing you.

Best,

I hope you're not too upset with me. I'm writing to apologize for missing our coffee appointment yesterday afternoon. I feel absolutely terrible about it.

Let me explain what happened. I was on my way to the café when my bike suddenly broke down near the bridge. To make matters worse, my phone battery had died that morning, so I had no way to contact you and let you know what was going on. By the time I managed to fix the bike and get to the café, you had already left. I completely understand if you were frustrated waiting for me.

I really value our friendship, and I hate that I let you down like this. To make it up to you, I'd love to treat you to lunch next week at that Italian restaurant you've been wanting to try. My treat, of course! 

Please let me know when you're free, and I promise I'll be there on time with a fully charged phone and a working bike!

Once again, I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience.

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## 2. Thư xin lỗi (Apology)submission of monthly report

Dear Ms. Johnson,

I am writing to express my sincere apologies for the late submission of the monthly sales report, which was due on January 25th but was only submitted this morning.

Unfortunately, I encountered unexpected technical difficulties with my computer system on the afternoon of January 24th. The hard drive crashed, resulting in the temporary loss of some critical data files. I immediately contacted the IT department, and they worked diligently to recover the files. However, the recovery process took longer than anticipated, which caused the delay.

I have now successfully retrieved all the necessary data and completed the comprehensive report, which is attached to this email for your review. I have also taken preventive measures by implementing a daily backup system to ensure that such incidents will not occur in the future.

I deeply regret any inconvenience this delay may have caused to the team's planning schedule. I take full responsibility for not having an adequate backup system in place earlier.

Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]

How's it going? I hope you've been well since we last met.

I saw your photos from Da Nang on Facebook last week – they looked absolutely stunning! The beaches and the Dragon Bridge at night were gorgeous. Your trip looked so fun that it inspired me to plan a family vacation there next month.

I'm writing to ask for your help with some travel tips since you just came back. First, could you recommend some good but affordable hotels near My Khe Beach? We're looking for something family-friendly with a nice view, and our budget is around $50-70 per night. Second, do we need to book tours like the Ba Na Hills or the Marble Mountains in advance, or can we just book them when we arrive? Also, how many days would you suggest staying there to see all the main attractions?

I'd really appreciate any advice you can give me. Your recommendations would be super helpful since you know the area well now.

Thanks a lot for your help! Let's catch up for coffee when I get back and I'll show you my photos too!
