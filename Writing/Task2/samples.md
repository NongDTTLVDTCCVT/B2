**Topic: Some people think that living in the city is better than living in the countryside. Do you agree or disagree?**

**Sample Essay (Agree - Living in city is better)**

It is often argued that living in urban areas brings more benefits than living in rural areas. Personally, I completely agree with this view because of the better job opportunities and modern facilities that cities offer.

**First of all**, the city provides much better career prospects. In big cities, there are hundreds of companies, factories, and organizations, which means there are thousands of jobs available for people. **For example**, a graduate with an IT degree can easily find a well-paid job in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, whereas it is very difficult to find such work in the countryside. Better jobs lead to higher income and a higher standard of living.

**Secondly**, the infrastructure and public services in cities are superior to those in the countryside. Cities are equipped with modern hospitals, prestigious universities, and convenient public transport systems. This ensures that citizens have access to the best healthcare and education. **In contrast**, people in remote areas often have to travel long distances to reach the nearest hospital, which can be dangerous in emergencies.

**Some people might argue that** the city is too polluted and noisy. **However**, I believe that the convenience and opportunities here outweigh these drawbacks. Additionally, many cities are now building more parks and planting trees to improve the living environment.

**In conclusion**, I strongly believe that living in the city is a better choice due to vast employment opportunities and high-quality public services. It is the ideal place for young people to develop their careers and enjoy a modern life.
