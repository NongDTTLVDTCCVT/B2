**Topic: Some people think that living in the city is better than living in the countryside. Do you agree or disagree?**

**Sample Essay (Agree - Living in city is better)**

It is often debated whether living in urban areas brings more benefits than living in rural areas. Personally, I completely agree with this view because of the superior job opportunities, modern facilities, and comprehensive public services that cities offer, which significantly improve quality of life and personal development prospects.

**First of all**, the city provides much better career prospects and economic opportunities that are simply unavailable in rural settings. In big cities like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, or Da Nang, there are hundreds of companies, factories, multinational corporations, and government organizations, which means there are thousands of diverse jobs available for people with different educational backgrounds and skill sets. **For example**, a graduate with an IT degree, engineering qualification, or business management diploma can easily find a well-paid professional job with competitive salaries and excellent career advancement opportunities in these major cities, whereas it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find such specialized work in the countryside where employment options are typically limited to agriculture or small local businesses. Better jobs lead to significantly higher income, more savings potential, and a dramatically higher standard of living. This economic advantage allows urban residents to invest in their children's education, access better healthcare, and accumulate wealth for the future.

**Secondly**, the infrastructure and public services in cities are vastly superior to those in the countryside in almost every measurable aspect. Cities are equipped with modern hospitals with specialized departments and advanced medical equipment, prestigious universities with qualified professors and extensive research facilities, comprehensive public transport systems including buses and metros that are reliable and affordable, well-maintained roads and highways, shopping centers with diverse products, cultural venues like museums and theaters, and recreational facilities. This ensures that citizens have convenient access to the best possible healthcare when they are sick or injured, world-class education for their children, and cultural enrichment. **In contrast**, people in remote rural areas often have to travel long distances, sometimes several hours, to reach the nearest hospital with adequate medical facilities, which can be dangerous and even life-threatening in medical emergencies like heart attacks or serious accidents.

**Some people might argue that** the city is too polluted with smog and vehicle emissions, excessively noisy with constant traffic and construction, and suffers from overcrowding and stress. These are legitimate concerns about urban life that cannot be completely dismissed. **However**, I firmly believe that the convenience, opportunities, and access to services here significantly outweigh these environmental and social drawbacks. Additionally, many modern cities are now implementing green urban planning by building more public parks, planting trees along streets, creating pedestrian zones, developing cycling infrastructure, and establishing stricter environmental regulations to improve the living environment and air quality.

**In conclusion**, I strongly believe that living in the city is a better choice for most people, especially young people and families, due to vast employment opportunities, high-quality public services, modern infrastructure, and better access to education and healthcare. It is the ideal place for ambitious young people to develop their careers, access quality education, and enjoy a modern, convenient life with diverse cultural and entertainment options.
