# Sample Questions & Answers: Artificial Intelligence

## Speaking

### Part 1: Social Interaction
**Q1: Do you use any AI applications in your daily life?**
*Sample:* "Yes, absolutely. I use virtual assistants like Google Assistant on my phone almost every day to set alarms or check the weather. It's extremely convenient and saves me a lot of time."
**Vocabulary:** Convenient (tiện lợi), Virtual assistant (trợ lý ảo).

**Q2: Do you think robots will replace teachers in the future?**
*Sample:* "I don't think so. While AI can provide information, it lacks the emotional intelligence and empathy that a human teacher has. Teachers not only teach knowledge but also inspire and care for students, which robots cannot do."
**Vocabulary:** Emotional intelligence (trí tuệ cảm xúc), Empathy (sự thấu cảm), Inspire (truyền cảm hứng).

### Part 2: Solution Discussion
**Situation:** You want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence. There are three options:
1. Taking an online course.
2. Reading books about AI.
3. Attending a workshop.

**Sample Answer:**
"In my opinion, **taking an online course** is the best choice. Firstly, AI is a technology field that updates very fast, and online courses are usually more up-to-date than books. Secondly, online courses often include interactive exercises and coding practice, which helps me understand algorithms better. While books provide deep theoretical knowledge, they might be outdated. Workshops are good for networking, but they might be too short to learn anything deeply. Therefore, an online course offers the best balance of theory and practice."

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Up-to-date (adj):** Cập nhật mới nhất.
- **Interactive (adj):** Có tính tương tác.
- **Theoretical knowledge:** Kiến thức lý thuyết.
- **Networking (n):** Tạo dựng mối quan hệ.
- **Outdated (adj):** Lỗi thời.

### Part 3: Topic Development
**Topic:** Impacts of AI on society.
- Employment (Job loss vs New jobs).
- Education (Personalized learning).
- Security (Face recognition).

**Sample Answer:**
"Artificial Intelligence brings significant changes to our society. **First of all**, regarding employment, AI helps automate repetitive tasks, which boosts productivity. However, it also raises fears about job displacement, especially for manual workers. **Secondly**, in education, AI can personalize learning paths for students, helping them study at their own pace. **Finally**, AI enhances security through technologies like face recognition, although this raises concerns about privacy. In conclusion, AI is beneficial, but we need to manage its risks carefully."

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Repetitive tasks:** Các công việc lặp đi lặp lại.
- **Personalize (v):** Cá nhân hóa.
- **At one's own pace:** Theo nhịp độ riêng của ai đó.
- **Face recognition:** Nhận diện khuôn mặt.

## Writing

### Task 1: Letter/Email
**Question:** You heard about a new AI tool that helps with writing English essays. Write an email to your friend, recommending this tool and explaining why it is useful.

**Sample Answer:**
Subject: You MUST Try This Amazing AI Writing Tool!

Hi Minh,

I hope you are doing well and that your exam preparation is going smoothly.

I am writing this email to tell you about a fantastic AI tool **specifically designed for** checking and improving English writing called "GrammarAI Pro" that I discovered yesterday while browsing YouTube. I immediately downloaded it and tested it with my practice essays.

As you know, we are both preparing for the B2 VSTEP exam, and writing has always been a real **challenge** for both of us, especially Task 2 essays. This tool is absolutely amazing because it not only corrects grammar and spelling mistakes but also suggests more advanced vocabulary and better sentence structures. It even explains why certain phrases are more appropriate than others. It's honestly like having a **private tutor** available 24/7! I tried it on my last practice essay about environmental issues, and the improved version sounded much more **natural** and academic.

You should definitely give it a try. The free version allows 10 checks per month, which is perfect for practice. It saves so much time compared to checking dictionaries and grammar books **manually**.

Let's meet for coffee this weekend at the usual place so I can show you exactly how to use it effectively.

Best regards,
Nam

### Task 2: Essay
**Question:** "Some people believe that Artificial Intelligence will eventually replace human workers in most jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

**Sample Answer:**
The rapid and unprecedented development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has **sparked a debate** about the future of human employment and the workforce. While some fear that AI will completely replace humans in most jobs, leading to mass unemployment, I partly disagree with this pessimistic view. I believe that while AI will certainly take over certain repetitive tasks, it will primarily serve to support and augment human workers rather than completely replace them in most sectors.

**On the one hand**, it is undeniable that AI is demonstrably **superior** to humans in **handling** specific types of **repetitive and data-heavy tasks** that require speed, accuracy, and consistency. Automation technologies and industrial robots are already widely used in manufacturing, data processing, accounting, and quality control because they work faster, more accurately, and more tirelessly than humans without breaks or errors. For example, in modern automobile factories, sophisticated robots can assemble entire cars efficiently 24/7 without getting tired, injured, or demanding salary increases. This leads to dramatically higher efficiency, increased production capacity, and lower operational costs for businesses. Similarly, AI algorithms can analyze massive datasets, detect patterns, and make predictions far more quickly than human analysts. In sectors like routine data entry, basic customer service, or assembly line work, AI and automation will inevitably reduce the need for human workers.

**On the other hand**, humans possess unique and irreplaceable qualities that machines fundamentally cannot **mimic** or replace, such as creativity, emotional intelligence, empathy, moral judgment, and complex critical thinking. Jobs that require genuine human connection, empathy, and emotional understanding, like nursing, teaching, psychology, counseling, or social work, will always need human interaction and presence. A robot or AI system can diagnose an illness based purely on data and symptoms, but it cannot comfort a frightened patient, hold their hand, or provide emotional support during difficult times. Teachers not only transmit information but also inspire students, recognize individual learning needs, and provide mentorship that shapes character. Furthermore, contrary to fears, the rise of AI actually creates numerous new job opportunities in fields like AI programming, algorithm development, machine maintenance, data science, AI ethics management, and human-AI interaction design, rather than just eliminating existing jobs. History shows that technological revolutions typically create more jobs than they destroy, though in different sectors.

**In conclusion**, while AI will inevitably and increasingly replace humans in repetitive, manual, and routine jobs, it fundamentally lacks **the human touch**, creativity, and emotional intelligence required for creative, social, and care-based professions. Therefore, instead of worrying excessively about being replaced, humans should focus strategically on developing uniquely human skills that AI cannot **replicate**, such as creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving, to **work alongside** technology productively and thrive in the AI age.
