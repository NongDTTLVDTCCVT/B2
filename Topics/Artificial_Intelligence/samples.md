# Sample Questions & Answers: Artificial Intelligence

## Speaking

### Part 1: Social Interaction
**Q1: Do you use any AI applications in your daily life?**
*Sample:* "Yes, absolutely. I use virtual assistants like Google Assistant on my phone almost every day to set alarms or check the weather. It’s extremely convenient and saves me a lot of time."
**Vocabulary:** Convenient (tiện lợi), Virtual assistant (trợ lý ảo).

**Q2: Do you think robots will replace teachers in the future?**
*Sample:* "I don't think so. While AI can provide information, it lacks the emotional intelligence and empathy that a human teacher has. Teachers not only teach knowledge but also inspire and care for students, which robots cannot do."
**Vocabulary:** Emotional intelligence (trí tuệ cảm xúc), Empathy (sự thấu cảm), Inspire (truyền cảm hứng).

### Part 2: Solution Discussion
**Situation:** You want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence. There are three options:
1. Taking an online course.
2. Reading books about AI.
3. Attending a workshop.

**Sample Answer:**
"In my opinion, **taking an online course** is the best choice. Firstly, AI is a technology field that updates very fast, and online courses are usually more up-to-date than books. Secondly, online courses often include interactive exercises and coding practice, which helps me understand algorithms better. While books provide deep theoretical knowledge, they might be outdated. Workshops are good for networking, but they might be too short to learn anything deeply. Therefore, an online course offers the best balance of theory and practice."

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Up-to-date (adj):** Cập nhật mới nhất.
- **Interactive (adj):** Có tính tương tác.
- **Theoretical knowledge:** Kiến thức lý thuyết.

### Part 3: Topic Development
**Topic:** Impacts of AI on society.
- Employment (Job loss vs New jobs).
- Education (Personalized learning).
- Security (Face recognition).

**Sample Answer:**
"Artificial Intelligence brings significant changes to our society. **First of all**, regarding employment, AI helps automate repetitive tasks, which boosts productivity. However, it also raises fears about job displacement, especially for manual workers. **Secondly**, in education, AI can personalize learning paths for students, helping them study at their own pace. **Finally**, AI enhances security through technologies like face recognition, although this raises concerns about privacy. In conclusion, AI is beneficial, but we need to manage its risks carefully."

## Writing

### Task 1: Letter/Email
**Question:** You heard about a new AI tool that helps with writing English essays. Write an email to your friend, recommending this tool and explaining why it is useful.

**Sample Answer:**
Subject: You must try this new AI writing tool!

Hi Minh,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing this email to tell you about a fantastic AI tool specifically designed for checking English writing called "GrammarAI" that I found yesterday.

I know we are both preparing for the B2 exam, and writing has always been a challenge. This tool is amazing because it not only corrects grammar mistakes but also suggests better vocabulary. It’s like having a private tutor 24/7. I tried it for my last essay, and my writing sounded much more natural.

You should definitely give it a try. It saves so much time compared to checking dictionaries manually.

Let's meet for coffee this weekend so I can show you how to use it.

Best regards,
Nam

- **Manually (adv):** Một cách thủ công.
- **Challenge (n):** Thử thách/Khó khăn.

### Task 2: Essay
**Question:** "Some people believe that Artificial Intelligence will eventually replace human workers in most jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

**Sample Answer:**
The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked a debate about the future of human employment. While some fear that AI will replace humans entirely, I partly disagree with this view. I believe that while AI will take over certain tasks, it will effectively support rather than completely replace human workers.

**On the one hand**, it is undeniable that AI is superior in handling repetitive and data-heavy tasks. Automation and robots are already widely used in manufacturing, calculating, and data processing because they work faster and more accurately than humans. For example, in factories, robots can assemble cars 24/7 without getting tired. This leads to higher efficiency and lower costs for businesses.

**On the other hand**, humans possess unique qualities that machines cannot mimic, such as creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking. Jobs that require empathy, like nursing, teaching, or psychology, will always need human interaction. A robot can diagnose an illness based on data, but it cannot comfort a patient who is in pain. Furthermore, the rise of AI creates new job opportunities in programming, maintenance, and ethics management, rather than just eliminating them.

**In conclusion**, while AI will inevitably replace humans in repetitive and manual jobs, it lacks the human touch required for creative and social professions. Therefore, instead of worrying about being replaced, humans should focus on developing skills that AI cannot replicate to work alongside technology.
