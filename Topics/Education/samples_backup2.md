## Speaking Part 1
**Q: Do you prefer studying alone or with friends?**

*   **Reason:** It helps me to concentrate better and I can learn at my own pace without distractions.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** A student wants to improve his English. Three options: *Study at a center*, *Hire a private tutor*, *Self-study online*.

**Sample Answer:**
“Well, regarding the situation where a student wants to improve his English, among the three options provided, I suppose that **studying at a center** is the most suitable choice.

First of all, studying at a language center offers a professional environment. Students can have access to modern facilities and learning materials, which makes learning more effective. Secondly, it provides opportunities to practice with peers. Interacting with other students helps improve communication skills and confidence. Finally, centers usually have a structured curriculum, ensuring that students learn systematically.

On the other hand, I don’t think hiring a private tutor is a good idea because it can be quite expensive. As for self-studying online, although it is convenient, it requires high self-discipline, and students might lack feedback from teachers.

In short, considering the professional environment and interaction opportunities, studying at a center is the best option.”

Subject: Inquiry about IELTS Preparation Course - Request for Information

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this email to request detailed information regarding the IELTS preparation course that is currently advertised on your website.

Firstly, could you please provide me with details about the course schedule and duration? I would specifically like to know how many hours per week the course runs and when the next intake will begin. As I am currently working full-time, I am particularly interested in whether you offer evening or weekend classes that would be suitable for working professionals.

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Some people think that university education is the best way to success. Others think that vocational training is better. Discuss both views.

**Sample Essay:**
It is often argued that entering university is the most effective route to a successful career, while others believe that vocational training is a better alternative. In my opinion, both paths have their own merits depending on individual career goals.

On the one hand, university education is essential for certain professions. Academic institutions provide students with in-depth theoretical knowledge and critical thinking skills. For example, careers in medicine, law, or engineering require formally recognized degrees and years of intensive study. Furthermore, a university degree is often seen as a requirement for high-level management positions in many large corporations.

On the other hand, vocational training offers significant advantages, particularly in terms of time and cost. Vocational courses are usually shorter and focused on practical skills, allowing young people to enter the workforce earlier. For instance, skilled workers such as mechanics, chefs, or electricians are always in high demand and can earn a stable income without the burden of student loans.

In conclusion, while university education is crucial for academic careers, vocational training is an excellent choice for those who prefer hands-on jobs. I believe that neither path ensures success; it depends on the person’s strengths and career aspirations.
