## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** A student wants to improve his English. Three options: *Study at a center*, *Hire a private tutor*, *Self-study online*.

**Sample Answer:**
"Well, regarding the situation where a student wants to improve his English, among the three options provided, I suppose that **studying at a center** is the most suitable choice.

First of all, studying at a language center offers a professional environment. Students can have access to modern facilities and learning materials, which makes learning more effective. Secondly, it provides opportunities to practice with peers. Interacting with other students helps improve communication skills and confidence. Finally, centers usually have a structured curriculum, ensuring that students learn systematically.

On the other hand, I don't think hiring a private tutor is a good idea because it can be quite expensive. As for self-studying online, although it is convenient, it requires high self-discipline, and students might lack feedback from teachers.

In short, considering the professional environment and interaction opportunities, studying at a center is the best option."

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this email to request detailed information regarding the IELTS preparation course that is currently advertised on your website.

Firstly, could you please provide me with details about the course schedule and duration?

As I am currently working full-time, I am particularly interested in whether you offer evening or weekend classes that would be suitable for working professionals.

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Some people think that university education is the best way to success. Others think that vocational training is better. Discuss both views.

**Sample Essay:**
It is often debated whether entering university is the most effective route to a successful career, while others argue that vocational training is a better alternative. In my opinion, both educational paths have their own distinct merits depending on individual career goals, personal strengths, and the specific industry one wishes to enter.

On the one hand, university education is absolutely essential and irreplaceable for certain professions that require advanced theoretical knowledge. Academic institutions provide students with in-depth theoretical knowledge, rigorous research skills, and critical thinking abilities that are fundamental to many professional fields. For example, careers in medicine, law, engineering, scientific research, or academia require formally recognized university degrees and years of intensive study and training. A doctor must understand complex human anatomy and biochemistry; a lawyer must master legal theory and case law; an engineer must apply mathematical principles to design structures. Furthermore, a university degree is often seen as a mandatory requirement for high-level management positions in many large corporations, government agencies, and international organizations. Employers in these sectors value the analytical skills, research capabilities, and discipline that university graduates demonstrate. Additionally, university provides opportunities for networking, access to research facilities, and exposure to diverse ideas that shape well-rounded professionals.

On the other hand, vocational training offers significant practical advantages, particularly in terms of time efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and direct job placement. Vocational courses are usually much shorter in duration, lasting between six months and two years, and are focused on practical hands-on skills that directly prepare students for specific jobs, allowing young people to enter the workforce earlier and start earning money sooner. For instance, skilled workers such as mechanics, chefs, electricians, plumbers, welders, or beauticians are always in extremely high demand in the labor market and can earn a stable and respectable income without the heavy financial burden of student loans that university students often face. In some cases, experienced tradespeople can earn more than office workers with bachelor''s degrees. Moreover, vocational training responds quickly to market needs and teaches current industry practices, making graduates immediately employable.

In conclusion, while university education is crucial and necessary for academic, professional, and management careers that require theoretical knowledge, vocational training is an excellent and equally valuable choice for those who prefer hands-on, practical jobs and want to enter the workforce quickly. I believe that neither path guarantees success automatically; it depends entirely on the person''s individual strengths, interests, aptitudes, and career aspirations. Society needs both university graduates and skilled tradespeople to function effectively.
