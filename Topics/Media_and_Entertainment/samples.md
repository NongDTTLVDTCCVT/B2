## Writing

### Task 1: Letter/Email
**Question:** Write a letter to a cable TV provider complaining about the poor quality of their service recently.

**Sample Answer:**
Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Service Quality - Account #12345

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my strong **dissatisfaction** with the internet and cable TV service provided by your company over the past two weeks.

Since last Monday, the internet connection has been extremely **unstable**, disconnecting multiple times per hour, which makes it nearly impossible to work or attend online meetings. Moreover, the TV signal keeps **freezing** and buffering, especially during prime time in the evening, which has caused significant **inconvenience** to my entire family. We have missed several important news broadcasts and entertainment programs we pay for.

I have attempted to contact your customer service hotline on three separate occasions – Monday, Wednesday, and Friday last week – but unfortunately, no one answered the phone despite waiting for over 20 minutes each time. This lack of response is completely unacceptable for a service provider of your reputation.

I respectfully request that you send a qualified technician to inspect and resolve this issue by the end of this week at the latest. If the problem **persists** beyond this timeframe, I will be forced to cancel my subscription and switch to a competitor who can provide reliable service.

I look forward to your prompt action and resolution.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]

### Task 2: Essay
**Question:** "Some people believe that celebrities earn too much money compared to other professions. Do you agree or disagree?"

**Sample Answer:**
It is often argued that famous people such as actors, singers, and football players receive salaries that are **unjustifiably** high compared to **essential workers** like doctors, teachers, or nurses. I completely agree with this viewpoint for several compelling reasons.

**Firstly**, the contribution of celebrities to society, while entertaining and culturally significant, is not as **vital** as other professions that directly impact people's wellbeing and survival. For instance, a doctor saves lives through medical expertise, and a teacher shapes the future generation by educating young minds. These jobs require years of **intense study**, continuous professional development, and carry immense responsibility for people's lives. A single mistake by a surgeon can be fatal, and teachers influence the trajectory of hundreds of students' futures. In contrast, while a singer brings joy and entertainment, and their work has cultural value, it does not solve critical societal problems such as disease, poverty, or ignorance. Therefore, it seems fundamentally unfair that a professional footballer can earn in a single week what a dedicated nurse working in intensive care earns in several years, despite the nurse's work being literally life-saving.

**Secondly**, this enormous **income gap** between celebrities and essential workers creates significant social inequality and distorts societal values. When wealth is concentrated in the entertainment and sports industries, it sends a problematic message to young people that becoming famous is more important and valuable than contributing to the community through hard work in science, education, or public service. This can discourage talented young people from pursuing careers in essential but underpaid fields. Furthermore, it reflects poorly on our society's priorities when we reward entertainment more generously than we reward saving lives or educating children.

**Additionally**, the argument that celebrities deserve high pay because of market forces and public demand does not justify the extreme disparity. While I acknowledge that entertainment generates significant revenue, this economic explanation does not make it morally or socially acceptable that the pay gap is so vast.

**In conclusion**, while celebrities undoubtedly work hard for their success and possess unique talents, I strongly believe their enormous income is **disproportionate** to their real value to society when compared to other essential professions. Society should reassess how it values and compensates different types of work to create a fairer system.
