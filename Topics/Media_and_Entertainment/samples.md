Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the internet and TV service provided by your company over the last week.

Since last Monday, the internet connection has been extremely unstable, and the TV signal keeps freezing, especially in the evening. This has caused significant inconvenience as I work from home and need a reliable connection. I tried calling your hotline twice, but no one picked up.

I request that you send a technician to check the issue immediately. If the problem persists, I will have to cancel my subscription and switch to another provider.

I look forward to your prompt resolution.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]

### Task 2: Essay
**Question:** "Some people believe that celebrities earn too much money compared to other professions. Do you agree or disagree?"

**Sample Answer:**
It is often argued that famous people such as actors, singers, and football players receive salaries that are unjustifiably high compared to essential workers like doctors or teachers. I completely agree with this viewpoint.

**Firstly**, the contribution of celebrities to society, while entertaining, is not as vital as other professions. For instance, a doctor saves lives and a teacher shapes the future generation. These jobs require years of intense study and carry immense responsibility. In contrast, while a singer brings joy, their work does not solve critical societal problems. Therefore, it seems unfair that a footballer earns in a week what a nurse earns in years.

**Secondly**, the income gap creates social inequality. When wealth is concentrated in the entertainment industry, it sends a wrong message to young people that becoming famous is more important than contributing to the community through hard work in science or education.

**In conclusion**, while celebrities work hard for their success, I believe their enormous income is disproportionate to their real value to society compared to other essential professions.

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Unjustifiably (adv):** Không thể biện minh được/Vô lý.
- **Essential workers:** Những người lao động thiết yếu.
- **Vital (adj):** Quan trọng sống còn.
- **Intense study:** Việc học tập căng thẳng/chuyên sâu.
- **Disproportionate (adj):** Không cân xứng.
- **Income gap:** Khoảng cách thu nhập.
