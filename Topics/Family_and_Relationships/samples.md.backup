### Task 2: Essay
**Question:** "Some people think that huge family gatherings are becoming less common in modern life. Why is this happening? Is this a negative or positive trend?"

**Sample Answer:**
In recent years, large family gatherings have become increasingly rare. This essay will discuss the reasons for this trend and argue that despite some practical benefits, it is largely a negative development.

The primary reason for fewer family get-togethers is the busy modern lifestyle. People are constantly under pressure from work and study, leaving them with little time for socializing, even with relatives. Additionally, urbanization has caused family members to live far apart in different cities or even countries, making frequent travel for reunions expensive and difficult.

However, I believe this is a negative trend. Family is the fundamental unit of support in society. When connections weaken, individuals may feel more isolated and lack emotional support during difficult times. Moreover, younger generations lose touch with their traditions and roots if they rarely interact with extended family members.

**In conclusion**, while distance and busy schedules are the main causes, the decline of family gatherings is regrettable as it weakens the family bond and emotional support systems.

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Get-together (n):** Buổi tụ tập/ngồi lại với nhau.
- **Urbanization (n):** Đô thị hóa.
- **Fundamental unit:** Đơn vị cơ bản/nền tảng.
- **Lose touch with:** Mất liên lạc/xa rời.
- **Regrettable (adj):** Đáng tiếc.
