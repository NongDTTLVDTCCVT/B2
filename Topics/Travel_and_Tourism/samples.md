## Writing

**Question:** Write an email to your English friend telling him about your recent trip to famous place in Vietnam.

**Sample Answer:**
Subject: My Amazing Trip to Ha Long Bay!

Hi John,

How have you been? I hope everything is going well with you and your family. I've been meaning to write to you for ages!

I'm writing to tell you about my incredible trip to Ha Long Bay last weekend. It was absolutely **breathtaking**! We took a two-day cruise around the islands, and I couldn't believe how stunning the limestone karsts were. On the first day, we visited the Sung Sot Cave, which is **massive** and filled with beautiful stalactites and stalagmites. The weather was perfect – sunny but not too hot, so we could enjoy kayaking around the quiet lagoons.

The highlight of the trip was definitely the seafood. We had a fresh seafood BBQ on the boat deck while watching the sunset. Everything tasted so **delicious** – especially the grilled squid and steamed crabs. I took tons of photos and videos; I'll send them to you via WhatsApp later this week.

You should definitely visit Vietnam next summer when you have time off. I'd love to be your tour guide and take you to Ha Long Bay and other amazing places.

Write back soon and let me know your plans!

Best wishes,
[Your Name]

### Task 2: Essay
**Question:** "Some people think that tourism does more harm than good to local cultures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

**Sample Answer:**
The growth of the tourism industry has raised concerns about its impact on local cultures and traditional ways of life. While some argue that tourism destroys cultural values and authenticity, I fundamentally disagree with this view. I believe that if managed properly and sustainably, tourism actually protects and promotes culture rather than harming it.

**On the one hand**, it is undeniably true that **mass tourism** can negatively affect local traditions when not properly regulated. When too many tourists arrive at once in popular destinations, historical sites and ancient monuments may suffer physical damage due to **overcrowding**, excessive foot traffic, and **littering**. For example, famous temples in Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu have experienced erosion from millions of visitors annually. Furthermore, some local residents may chase short-term profits by **commercializing** their culture inappropriately, such as creating inauthentic performances purely for tourists or selling fake traditional products mass-produced in factories, which compromises the **authenticity** of their heritage. This "Disneyfication" of culture can make traditions feel artificial and strip them of their original meaning and spiritual significance.

**On the other hand**, tourism is fundamentally a powerful and positive tool for cultural **preservation** and economic sustainability. Firstly, the **revenue** generated from tourism provides essential funds to restore and maintain temples, monuments, historical buildings, and archaeological sites. Without this income stream, many precious sites would continue to **degrade** over time due to lack of funding for conservation. UNESCO World Heritage Sites globally depend heavily on tourism revenue for their preservation. Secondly, tourism encourages and motivates local people to be proud of their customs, traditions, and cultural identity. When foreigners show genuine interest in traditional dances, handicrafts, festivals, or local cuisines, the local community feels validated and is motivated to keep those traditions alive and pass them on to younger generations. This creates economic incentives to preserve rather than abandon cultural practices. Additionally, cultural tourism creates jobs for local guides, artisans, and performers, providing economic alternatives to industries that might harm the environment.

**In conclusion**, while there are legitimate risks of commercialization, overcrowding, and physical damage to sites, the overall benefits of tourism for cultural preservation, economic development, and promotion of cultural pride are significant and outweigh the negatives. Therefore, I believe tourism does far more good than harm, provided that tourists are educated to respect local customs, regulations are enforced, and tourism is developed sustainably with community involvement.
