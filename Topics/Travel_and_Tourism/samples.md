### Task 2: Essay
**Question:** "Some people think that tourism does more harm than good to local cultures. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

**Sample Answer:**
The growth of the tourism industry has raised concerns about its impact on local cultures. While some argue that tourism destroys cultural values, I disagree with this view. I believe that if managed properly, tourism protects and promotes culture rather than harming it.

**On the one hand**, it is true that mass tourism can negatively affect local traditions. When too many tourists arrive, historical sites may be damaged due to overcrowding and littering. Furthermore, some locals may chase profits by commercializing their culture, such as selling fake traditional products, which loses the authenticity of their heritage.

**On the other hand**, tourism is a powerful tool for cultural preservation. Firstly, the revenue from tourism provides funds to restore temples, monuments, and historical buildings. Without this income, many sites would degrade over time. Secondly, tourism encourages locals to be proud of their customs. When foreigners show interest in traditional dances, crafts, or festivals, the local people are motivated to keep those traditions alive.

**In conclusion**, while there are risks of commercialization and damage, the benefits of tourism for cultural preservation and promotion are significant. Therefore, I believe tourism does more good than good, provided that tourists are educated to respect local customs.

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Mass tourism:** Du lịch đại trà (quá đông).
- **Overcrowding (n):** Tình trạng quá tải.
- **Littering (n):** Vứt rác bừa bãi.
- **Commercialize (v):** Thương mại hóa.
- **Authenticity (n):** Tính xác thực/Tính nguyên bản.
- **Preservation (n):** Sự bảo tồn.
