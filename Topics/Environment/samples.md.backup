# Samples: Environment

## Speaking Part 1
**Q: Is there any pollution in your country?**
- **Answer:** Yes, unfortunately. Air pollution is a big problem in big cities.
- **Reason:** There are too many motorbikes and cars on the streets emitting exhaust fumes.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** Your local area is facing heavy pollution. Three solutions: *Organize a clean-up day*, *Plant more trees*, *Punish people who litter*.

**Sample Answer:**
"Well, facing the problem of heavy pollution in the local area, among the three solutions provided, I firmly believe that **punishing people who litter** is the most effective measure.

Firstly, imposing strict fines raises people's awareness immediately. When people are afraid of losing money, they will think twice before dropping trash on the street. This creates a deterrent effect. Secondly, this is a long-term solution. While other methods might tackle the symptoms, strict regulations tackle the root cause which is human behavior.

On the other hand, organizing a clean-up day is only a temporary fix. The area will become dirty again if people continue to litter. Similarly, planting trees is a good idea for the environment, but it takes many years for trees to grow and have a noticeable effect on pollution levels.

Therefore, punishment is the most practical and immediate solution."

## Speaking Part 3 (Full Sample Answer)
**Topic: Causes of environmental pollution**
- Industrial activities
- Transportation
- Human awareness

**Sample Answer:**
"Pollution is a pressing issue today, and there are three main causes for this problem: industrial activities, transportation, and human awareness.

First of all, **industrial activities** contribute significantly to pollution. Many factories release untreated waste into rivers and toxic smoke into the air, which poisons our water sources and atmosphere.

Secondly, the increase in **transportation** is another major factor. With millions of private vehicles like motorbikes and cars on the road, the amount of exhaust fumes emitted daily is enormous, leading to severe air pollution in big cities.

Finally, **human awareness** plays a critical role. Many people still have the habit of littering/dropping litter in public places or using single-use plastic products, which ends up in landfills and oceans.

In conclusion, to protect our planet, we need to address these three main sources of pollution."

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Environmental problems are becoming serious. Some people say that it is the responsibility of the government, while others believe individuals should take action. Discuss.

**Sample Essay:**

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Environmental degradation:** Sự suy thoái môi trường.
- **Enforce regulations:** Thực thi các quy định.
- **Renewable energy sources:** Các nguồn năng lượng tái tạo.
- **Carbon footprint:** Dấu chân carbon (Lượng khí thải CO2 do cá nhân/tổ chức thải ra).
- **Joint effort:** Nỗ lực chung.
Environmental degradation is one of the most critical challenges of our time. While significant debate exists over who should take the lead in solving these problems, I believe that it requires a joint effort from both the government and individuals.

On the one hand, the government plays a vital role in environmental protection. Only the government has the power to pass laws and enforce regulations to limit emissions from factories and vehicles. For instance, imposing carbon taxes or banning single-use plastics can have a massive impact on a national scale. Moreover, governments can invest in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to replace fossil fuels, which requires huge financial resources that individuals do not have.

On the other hand, individual actions are equally important. If every person makes small changes in their daily lives, the collective effect will be enormous. Simple actions such as separating waste for recycling, using public transport instead of private cars, and saving electricity can significantly reduce the carbon footprint. Without the cooperation of citizens, government policies would be ineffective.

In conclusion, protecting the environment is not the sole responsibility of any single party. It demands strong policies from the government and active participation from every individual to create a sustainable future.
