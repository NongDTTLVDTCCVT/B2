# Samples: Environment

## Speaking Part 1
**Q: Is there any pollution in your country?**
- **Answer:** Yes, unfortunately. Air pollution is a big problem in big cities.
- **Reason:** There are too many motorbikes and cars on the streets emitting exhaust fumes.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** Your local area is facing heavy pollution. Three solutions: *Organize a clean-up day*, *Plant more trees*, *Punish people who litter*.

**Sample Answer:**
"Well, facing the problem of heavy pollution in the local area, among the three solutions provided, I firmly believe that **punishing people who litter** is the most effective measure.

Firstly, imposing strict fines raises people's awareness immediately. When people are afraid of losing money, they will think twice before dropping trash on the street. This creates a deterrent effect. Secondly, this is a long-term solution. While other methods might tackle the symptoms, strict regulations tackle the root cause which is human behavior.

On the other hand, organizing a clean-up day is only a temporary fix. The area will become dirty again if people continue to litter. Similarly, planting trees is a good idea for the environment, but it takes many years for trees to grow and have a noticeable effect on pollution levels.

Therefore, punishment is the most practical and immediate solution."

## Speaking Part 3 (Full Sample Answer)
**Topic: Causes of environmental pollution**
- Industrial activities
- Transportation
- Human awareness

**Sample Answer:**
"Pollution is a pressing issue today, and there are three main causes for this problem: industrial activities, transportation, and human awareness.

First of all, **industrial activities** contribute significantly to pollution. Many factories release untreated waste into rivers and toxic smoke into the air, which poisons our water sources and atmosphere.

Secondly, the increase in **transportation** is another major factor. With millions of private vehicles like motorbikes and cars on the road, the amount of exhaust fumes emitted daily is enormous, leading to severe air pollution in big cities.

Finally, **human awareness** plays a critical role. Many people still have the habit of littering/dropping litter in public places or using single-use plastic products, which ends up in landfills and oceans.

In conclusion, to protect our planet, we need to address these three main sources of pollution."

## Writing Task 1 (Full Letter of Complaint)
**Topic:** Write a letter to the local council complaining about the garbage problem in your neighborhood.

**Sample Letter:**
Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my strong **dissatisfaction** regarding the persistent uncollected rubbish problem in my neighborhood at 123 Nguyen Trai Street, which has become increasingly severe over the past week.

For the past five days, the garbage collection truck has completely failed to arrive to collect the waste as scheduled. As a direct result, enormous piles of trash have **accumulated** on the sidewalks and street corners, creating an eyesore and health hazard. The smell emanating from the rotting organic waste is becoming absolutely **unbearable**, particularly in this hot and humid summer weather, and it is affecting residents' quality of life significantly.

This dire situation is causing multiple serious problems for all residents in the area. The decomposing waste is attracting large numbers of rats, flies, cockroaches, and other disease-carrying insects, which clearly **poses a health risk** to our entire community, especially to young children and elderly people who are more vulnerable to infections. Furthermore, the overflowing garbage ruins the aesthetic landscape of our previously clean street and has caused property values in the area to decline.

I strongly urge you to send a **sanitation team** to clean up the affected area immediately within the next 24 hours. Additionally, I sincerely hope that the council will implement stricter supervision to ensure that the garbage collection schedule is maintained properly and consistently in the future to prevent such unacceptable situations from recurring.

I look forward to receiving confirmation of your **prompt action** on this urgent matter.

Yours faithfully,
Tran Van B

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Environmental problems are becoming serious. Some people say that it is the responsibility of the government, while others believe individuals should take action. Discuss.

**Sample Essay:**
**Environmental degradation** is one of the most critical and pressing challenges of our time, threatening ecosystems, human health, and future generations. While significant debate exists over who should take the lead in solving these environmental problems, I believe that it requires a comprehensive **joint effort** from both the government and individuals working in partnership.

On the one hand, the government plays an absolutely vital and irreplaceable role in environmental protection that individuals simply cannot fulfill. Only the government has the legislative power to pass laws and **enforce regulations** strictly to limit harmful emissions from factories, vehicles, and industrial activities. For instance, imposing carbon taxes on polluting industries or banning single-use plastics nationwide can have a massive and immediate impact on a national scale that individual actions cannot match. A single government policy can affect millions of people and thousands of businesses simultaneously. Moreover, governments can invest enormous financial resources in **renewable energy sources** like solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power to replace fossil fuels, which requires huge capital investments and infrastructure development that individuals do not have access to. Governments can also fund scientific research into climate solutions, establish protected nature reserves, and negotiate international environmental agreements. Without strong governmental action and enforcement, environmental protection efforts would be fragmented and insufficient.

On the other hand, individual actions are equally important and should not be underestimated or dismissed. If every single person makes small but consistent changes in their daily lives, the collective cumulative effect will be enormous and can complement government policies effectively. Simple everyday actions such as properly separating waste for recycling, using public transport or bicycles instead of private cars, conserving electricity by turning off lights and appliances, reducing meat consumption, and avoiding single-use plastics can significantly reduce each person's **carbon footprint**. For example, if all citizens in a city chose to recycle diligently, waste management costs would decrease dramatically. Additionally, individual consumer choices create market pressure on companies to adopt environmentally friendly practices. When consumers demand sustainable products, businesses respond by changing their production methods. Furthermore, without the active cooperation and participation of citizens, even the best government policies would be ineffective and unenforceable. Laws mean nothing if people do not comply.

In conclusion, protecting the environment is definitely not the sole responsibility of any single party or entity. It demands strong comprehensive policies, strict enforcement from the government, and simultaneous active participation from every individual to create a truly sustainable future for our planet and future generations.
