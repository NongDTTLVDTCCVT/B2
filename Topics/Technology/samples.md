## Speaking Part 1
**Q: How often do you use the Internet?**
- **Answer:** I use it on a daily basis, almost 24/7.
- **Reason:** It is indispensible for my work and study. I need to check emails and search for information constantly.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** You want to buy a device for studying. Three options: *Laptop*, *Tablet*, *Smartphone*.
**Choice: Laptop.**

**Sample Answer:**
“In this situation, where I need to buy a device for studying, I would definitely choose the **laptop**.

First of all, a laptop is the most versatile tool for education. It has a physical keyboard which makes typing essays and assignments much faster and more accurate than on a touch screen. Secondly, laptops support powerful software that is often required for schoolwork, such as complex presentation tools or coding programs, which tablets or phones might not run effectively.

I would not choose the smartphone because the screen is too small for reading long documents or working on detailed projects, which can be bad for the eyes. Similarly, while a tablet is portable, it is more suitable for entertainment like watching movies rather than doing serious work, and typing on it is quite inconvenient.

So, for study purposes, a laptop is the best investment.”

## Speaking Part 3 (Full Sample Answer)
**Topic: Disadvantages of Mobile Phones**
- Distraction
- Health issues
- Social isolation

**Sample Answer:**
“It is undeniable that mobile phones bring many benefits, but they also have significant disadvantages. Three main drawbacks are distraction, health issues, and social isolation.

First, mobile phones are a major source of **distraction**. Students often lose focus during class because they are busy checking notifications or scrolling through social media like Facebook or TikTok. This affects their academic performance.

Finally, phones can contribute to **social isolation**. Ironically, while they connect us virtually, they disconnect us from the real world. Many people prefer texting to talking face-to-face, even when they are sitting next to each other in a café.

In conclusion, we should use mobile phones wisely to avoid these negative effects.”

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Social media (Facebook, TikTok) has more negative effects than positive ones. Do you agree?

**Sample Essay:**
The popularity of social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok has sparked a debate about their impact on society. While some argue that they do more harm than good, I believe that social media is a double-edged sword, and its effects depend largely on how it is used.

- **Lifeline (n):** Dây cứu sinh / Phao cứu sinh (nghĩa bóng: thứ cực kỳ quan trọng giúp duy trì sự sống/kết nối).
- **Accessible knowledge:** Kiến thức dễ tiếp cận.

On the one hand, there are undeniable negatives. The most alarming issue is addiction. Many young people spend hours scrolling endlessly, wasting time that could be used for study or exercise. Furthermore, social media often spreads fake news and promotes unrealistic lifestyles, which can lead to anxiety and low self-esteem. Cyberbullying is another danger that can have severe mental health consequences.

On the other hand, the benefits of social media cannot be overlooked. It is a powerful tool for connection, allowing people to keep in touch with family and friends regardless of distance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was a lifeline for many. Additionally, it is a vast source of information and education. Many educational channels on TikTok or YouTube provide free and accessible knowledge to millions.

In conclusion, although the risks of addiction and misinformation are real, I do not agree that social media has more negative effects. If used responsibly, it is a valuable tool for communication and learning. Users should be educated on how to use it wisely to maximize the benefits.
