# Samples: Technology

## Speaking Part 1
**Q: How often do you use the Internet?**
- **Answer:** I use it on a daily basis, almost 24/7.
- **Reason:** It is indispensible for my work and study. I need to check emails and search for information constantly.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** You want to buy a device for studying. Three options: *Laptop*, *Tablet*, *Smartphone*.
**Choice: Laptop.**

**Sample Answer:**
“In this situation, where I need to buy a device for studying, I would definitely choose the **laptop**.

First of all, a laptop is the most versatile tool for education. It has a physical keyboard which makes typing essays and assignments much faster and more accurate than on a touch screen. Secondly, laptops support powerful software that is often required for schoolwork, such as complex presentation tools or coding programs, which tablets or phones might not run effectively.

I would not choose the smartphone because the screen is too small for reading long documents or working on detailed projects, which can be bad for the eyes. Similarly, while a tablet is portable, it is more suitable for entertainment like watching movies rather than doing serious work, and typing on it is quite inconvenient.

So, for study purposes, a laptop is the best investment.”

## Speaking Part 3 (Full Sample Answer)
**Topic: Disadvantages of Mobile Phones**
- Distraction
- Health issues
- Social isolation

**Sample Answer:**
“It is undeniable that mobile phones bring many benefits, but they also have significant disadvantages. Three main drawbacks are distraction, health issues, and social isolation.

First, mobile phones are a major source of **distraction**. Students often lose focus during class because they are busy checking notifications or scrolling through social media like Facebook or TikTok. This affects their academic performance.

Second, excessive phone use leads to **health issues**. Staring at the small screen for hours can cause eye strain and headaches. Moreover, the blue light from screens can disrupt sleep patterns, causing insomnia.

Finally, phones can contribute to **social isolation**. Ironically, while they connect us virtually, they disconnect us from the real world. Many people prefer texting to talking face-to-face, even when they are sitting next to each other in a café.

In conclusion, we should use mobile phones wisely to avoid these negative effects.”

**Topic:** Write an email to a friend inviting them to join a computer programming club.

**Sample Email:**
Subject: Invitation to Join the Programming Club - You'll Love This!

Hi Minh,

How are you doing? I hope you are studying well and everything is going smoothly with your courses. I haven't seen you for ages since the last semester ended – we really need to catch up!

I am writing to invite you to join a brand new computer programming club that has just been established at our university. I know you are very **interested in** technology and IT, especially app development, so I think this club would be absolutely perfect for you and your career goals.

The club organizes weekly workshops where members can learn how to code basic mobile applications using Python and Java, and we also have sessions on website design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also a great **opportunity** to meet like-minded people who share the same **passion** for technology. The instructors are senior students who work as freelance developers, so they have real industry experience to share.

The club meets every Saturday morning from 9 AM to 12 PM at Room 301 in the IT building. The first session starts next Saturday, so there's still time to register. The membership fee is only 100,000 VND for the whole semester, which I think is very reasonable.

Let me know as soon as possible if you want to join so we can **sign up** together. I've already registered and I'm really excited about it!

Best regards,
Nam

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Social media (Facebook, TikTok) has more negative effects than positive ones. Do you agree?

**Sample Essay:**
The popularity of social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram has **sparked a debate** about their impact on modern society. While some argue that they do more harm than good, I believe that social media is fundamentally a **double-edged sword**, and its effects depend largely on how responsibly it is used by individuals and regulated by governments.

On the one hand, there are undeniable and serious negative aspects that cannot be ignored. The most alarming issue is addiction, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Many young people spend countless hours scrolling endlessly through feeds, watching short videos, and checking notifications compulsively, wasting valuable time that could be productively used for studying, exercising, or developing real-world relationships. This excessive screen time has been linked to attention deficit issues and reduced academic performance. Furthermore, social media platforms often spread **fake news** and misinformation at an alarming rate, as sensational content spreads faster than factual information. They also promote unrealistic lifestyles, beauty standards, and materialistic values through carefully curated posts and filtered images, which can lead to serious mental health problems including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, especially among impressionable young users. **Cyberbullying** is another grave danger that has driven some victims to suicide. Online harassment can be relentless and public, causing severe psychological trauma.

On the other hand, the benefits and positive impacts of social media cannot be overlooked or dismissed entirely. It is undeniably a powerful tool for connection and communication, allowing people to keep in touch with family and friends regardless of geographical distance. For immigrants and people with relatives abroad, platforms like Facebook are invaluable. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was literally a **lifeline** for millions of isolated people, enabling them to maintain social connections, work remotely, and access vital information. Additionally, social media serves as a vast democratized source of information and education. Many educational channels on TikTok, YouTube, and other platforms provide free and easily **accessible knowledge** to millions of people who might not have access to traditional educational resources. Social movements for social justice and environmental protection have also been amplified through social media.

In conclusion, although the risks of addiction, misinformation, and mental health impacts are real and concerning, I do not agree that social media has overwhelmingly more negative effects than positive ones. If used responsibly and with proper digital literacy education, it remains a valuable tool for communication, learning, and social connection. Users should be educated on how to use it wisely, and platforms should be regulated to minimize harm while maximizing benefits.
