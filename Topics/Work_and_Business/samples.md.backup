## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** You are looking for a job. What is the most important factor? *High salary*, *Good working environment*, *Promotion opportunities*.
**Choice: Good working environment.**

**Sample Answer:**
“If I were looking for a job, among the three factors: high salary, good working environment, and promotion opportunities, I would prioritize a **good working environment**.

Firstly, we spend at least 8 hours a day, which is one-third of our lives, at work. Therefore, feeling happy and comfortable there is essential for mental health. A supportive and friendly environment reduces stress and keeps me motivated. If the environment is toxic, even a high salary cannot compensate for the misery.

Secondly, while a high salary is attractive, it does not guarantee long-term satisfaction. I would rather earn a moderate income in a place where I feel respected than a high income in a place I hate. As for promotion opportunities, they are important, but they often come naturally if you work in a good environment where your efforts are recognized.

In short, a positive working environment is the foundation for a sustainable career.”
