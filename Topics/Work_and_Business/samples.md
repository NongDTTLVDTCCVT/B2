# Samples: Work & Business

## Speaking Part 1
**Q: Would you like to work in a big city or in the countryside?**
- **Answer:** I prefer working in a big city.
- **Reason:** There are more job opportunities and higher salaries. Also, the professional network is better.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** You are looking for a job. What is the most important factor? *High salary*, *Good working environment*, *Promotion opportunities*.
**Choice: Good working environment.**

**Sample Answer:**
"If I were looking for a job, among the three factors: high salary, good working environment, and promotion opportunities, I would prioritize a **good working environment**.

Firstly, we spend at least 8 hours a day, which is one-third of our lives, at work. Therefore, feeling happy and comfortable there is essential for mental health. A supportive and friendly environment reduces stress and keeps me motivated. If the environment is toxic, even a high salary cannot compensate for the misery.

Secondly, while a high salary is attractive, it does not guarantee long-term satisfaction. I would rather earn a moderate income in a place where I feel respected than a high income in a place I hate. As for promotion opportunities, they are important, but they often come naturally if you work in a good environment where your efforts are recognized.

In short, a positive working environment is the foundation for a sustainable career."

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Many people work remotely (from home). Discuss advantages and disadvantages.

**Sample Essay:**
In recent years, working remotely has become a popular trend globally, accelerated dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic. While this working style offers significant **flexibility** and convenience, it also presents certain challenges that need to be carefully considered by both employers and employees.

On the one hand, working from home provides obvious and substantial **advantages** for both workers and companies. The most significant benefit is flexibility in managing one's schedule and working environment. Employees can organize their own time more efficiently, create a personalized and comfortable workspace tailored to their preferences, and often experience increased productivity as a result. For example, people can work during their most productive hours, whether early morning or late evening, without being constrained by traditional office hours. Furthermore, remote work saves a considerable amount of time and money on commuting. The average worker in major cities spends two to three hours daily in traffic, which is exhausting and expensive. Without the stress of traffic jams and crowded public transport, workers can start their day with more energy, reduce transportation costs, and achieve a better **work-life balance**. Additionally, companies can reduce overhead costs by downsizing office space, and they can hire talent from anywhere in the world without geographical limitations.

On the other hand, there are several notable **disadvantages** that cannot be ignored. The biggest challenge is the lack of direct face-to-face social interaction with colleagues. Working in **isolation** for extended periods can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and disconnection from the company culture, making collaboration and teamwork more difficult. The spontaneous conversations and brainstorming sessions that happen naturally in offices are lost. Additionally, distractions at home, such as family members, children, pets, or household chores, can significantly affect concentration and productivity. Many people struggle to establish boundaries between work and personal time. It is also psychologically hard for some people to separate their professional life from their personal life when their office is literally their bedroom or living room, leading to burnout as work never truly "ends."

In conclusion, remote work is generally a positive development that offers freedom and convenience for modern professionals. However, to be successful long-term, it requires high **self-discipline**, proper workspace setup, and conscious effort to maintain social connections and work-life boundaries.
