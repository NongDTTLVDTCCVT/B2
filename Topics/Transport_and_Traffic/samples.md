## Speaking Part 1
**Q: How do you go to work/school?**

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** Traveling from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. *By plane*, *By train*, *By coach*.
**Choice: By plane.**

**Sample Answer:**
“If I had to travel a long distance from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, I would definitely choose going **by plane** instead of by train or coach.

The main reason for my choice is time efficiency. A flight takes only about 2 hours, whereas a train or coach journey can take up to 30 hours. Saving time is very important to me. Furthermore, flying is generally safer and much more comfortable. I can relax and arrive at the destination feeling fresh.

On the other hand, traveling by train takes too much time. Although it is safer than a coach, the long journey can be exhausting. As for the coach, I would not choose it because it is the most uncomfortable option. Sitting in a cramped space for more than a day is very tiring, and it is also less safe compared to the other two options.

Therefore, despite the higher cost, the plane is the best choice for such a long trip.”

## Speaking Part 3 (Full Sample Answer)
**Topic: Solutions to Traffic Congestion**
- Improve public transport
- Upgrade infrastructure
- Restrict private vehicles

**Sample Answer:**
“Traffic congestion is a nightmare in many big cities. To solve this problem, authorities should focus on three main solutions: improving public transport, upgrading infrastructure, and restricting private vehicles.

First of all, **improving public transport** is crucial. If buses and trains are cheap, reliable, and comfortable, people will be encouraged to leave their personal cars at home. This is the most sustainable way to reduce traffic volume.

Secondly, we need to **upgrade infrastructure**. The government should widen narrow roads and build more flyovers, tunnels, and ring roads to help traffic flow more smoothly during rush hours.

Finally, **restricting private vehicles** can be an effective measure. For example, some cities ban cars from the city center during peak hours or charge congestion fees. This forces people to consider alternative modes of transport.

In conclusion, solving traffic jams requires a combination of better facilities and strict policies.”

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Gridlocked (adj):** Kẹt cứng, không nhúc nhích được (giao thông).
- **At a snail's pace (idiom):** Chậm như sên.
- **Ongoing construction:** Công trình đang thi công.
- **Occupy (v):** Chiếm dụng (vỉa hè, không gian).
- **Prompt immediate action:** Thúc đẩy hành động ngay lập tức.ng between 7 am and 8 am, the traffic is completely gridlocked. Vehicles move at a snail's pace, and it often takes me an hour to travel just 5 kilometers. The noise from honking horns and the dust from exhaust fumes are affecting the health and quality of life of local residents.

The main cause of this problem seems to be the ongoing construction of the skytrain project, which has blocked half of the road. Additionally, many street vendors occupy the sidewalks, forcing pedestrians to walk on the street.

I suggest that the city authorities should speed up the construction work and clear the sidewalks to improve traffic flow. I hope your newspaper can raise awareness of this issue to prompt immediate action.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Should the government ban private cars from city centers to reduce pollution and traffic jams?

**Sample Essay:**

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Drastically reduce:** Giảm mạnh/giảm đáng kể.
- **Walkable environment:** Môi trường thân thiện với người đi bộ.

- **Necessity (n):** Sự cần thiết/Thứ thiết yếu.
- **Implement (v):** Thi hành, áp dụng (chính sách, luật).
Traffic congestion and air pollution are becoming increasingly serious in major cities. Some people suggest that the government should ban private cars from city centers to solve these issues. While I agree that this measure has significant benefits, I believe it should only be implemented if certain conditions are met.

On the one hand, banning cars would bring immediate benefits. Firstly, it would drastically reduce **air pollution**. Fewer cars mean fewer exhaust fumes, leading to cleaner air and better public health. Secondly, it would improve **road safety** for pedestrians and cyclists, making the city center a more pleasant and walkable environment. Furthermore, without private cars, traffic jams would be significantly reduced, allowing public transport to move faster.

On the other hand, a total ban would cause major **inconvenience** for many people. Those who live in the suburbs and work in the city would struggle to commute if the public transport system is not developed enough. For families with young children or elderly members, a private car is often a necessity. Therefore, simply banning cars without providing a viable alternative would be unfair.

In conclusion, banning private cars is a good long-term goal. However, before implementing it, the government must first invest in a high-quality, efficient public transport system to ensure that citizens can travel easily without their cars.
