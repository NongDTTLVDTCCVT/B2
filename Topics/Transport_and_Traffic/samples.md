## Speaking Part 1
**Q: How do you go to work/school?**
- **Answer:** I go by motorbike mostly.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** Traveling from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. *By plane*, *By train*, *By coach*.
**Choice: By plane.**

**Sample Answer:**
“If I had to travel a long distance from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, I would definitely choose going **by plane** instead of by train or coach.

The main reason for my choice is time efficiency. A flight takes only about 2 hours, whereas a train or coach journey can take up to 30 hours. Saving time is very important to me. Furthermore, flying is generally safer and much more comfortable. I can relax and arrive at the destination feeling fresh.

On the other hand, traveling by train takes too much time. Although it is safer than a coach, the long journey can be exhausting. As for the coach, I would not choose it because it is the most uncomfortable option. Sitting in a cramped space for more than a day is very tiring, and it is also less safe compared to the other two options.

Therefore, despite the higher cost, the plane is the best choice for such a long trip.”

## Speaking Part 3 (Full Sample Answer)
**Topic: Solutions to Traffic Congestion**
- Improve public transport
- Upgrade infrastructure
- Restrict private vehicles

**Sample Answer:**
“Traffic congestion is a nightmare in many big cities. To solve this problem, authorities should focus on three main solutions: improving public transport, upgrading infrastructure, and restricting private vehicles.

First of all, **improving public transport** is crucial. If buses and trains are cheap, reliable, and comfortable, people will be encouraged to leave their personal cars at home. This is the most sustainable way to reduce traffic volume.

Secondly, we need to **upgrade infrastructure**. The government should widen narrow roads and build more flyovers, tunnels, and ring roads to help traffic flow more smoothly during rush hours.

Finally, **restricting private vehicles** can be an effective measure. For example, some cities ban cars from the city center during peak hours or charge congestion fees. This forces people to consider alternative modes of transport.

In conclusion, solving traffic jams requires a combination of better facilities and strict policies.”

## Writing Task 1 (Full Sample Formal Letter)
**Topic:** Write a letter to the local newspaper about the traffic jams in your area.

**Sample Letter:**
Dear Editor,

I am writing to draw your attention to the severe and worsening traffic congestion that occurs daily on Nguyen Trai Street in District 5, which has become a major concern for all local residents and commuters.

Every morning between 7 AM and 9 AM, the traffic is completely **gridlocked**, with vehicles barely moving. It is not uncommon for commuters to spend over an hour traveling just 5 kilometers, moving **at a snail's pace**. The situation has deteriorated significantly over the past six months. The constant noise from honking horns and the thick dust from exhaust fumes are seriously affecting the health and quality of life of thousands of local residents, particularly elderly people and young children who are most vulnerable.

The main cause of this problem appears to be the **ongoing construction** of the elevated skytrain project, which has blocked two out of three lanes on the road. Additionally, many street vendors illegally **occupy** the sidewalks, forcing pedestrians to walk on the street alongside vehicles, which creates additional safety hazards and further reduces road capacity.

I strongly suggest that the city authorities should accelerate the construction work by employing night shifts or increasing the workforce. Furthermore, they should clear the sidewalks and relocate the vendors to designated market areas. I sincerely hope your newspaper can raise public awareness of this critical issue to **prompt immediate action** from the relevant authorities.

Yours faithfully,
Tran Van B

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Should the government ban private cars from city centers to reduce pollution and traffic jams?

**Sample Essay:**
Traffic congestion and air pollution are becoming increasingly serious problems in major cities worldwide, affecting both public health and quality of life. Some people suggest that the government should ban private cars from city centers to solve these pressing issues. While I agree that this measure has significant benefits for the environment and urban livability, I believe it should only be **implemented** if certain crucial conditions are met first.

On the one hand, banning private cars from downtown areas would bring immediate and substantial benefits to urban environments. Firstly, it would **drastically reduce air pollution**, which is a major health hazard in many metropolitan areas. Fewer cars directly mean fewer exhaust fumes, leading to cleaner air, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and better public health outcomes. Studies from cities like Oslo and Copenhagen that have implemented car-free zones show measurable improvements in air quality within months. Secondly, eliminating private vehicles would significantly improve **road safety** for pedestrians and cyclists, making the city center a much more pleasant, peaceful, and **walkable environment**. Children could play more safely, elderly people could move around with less anxiety, and street life would be revitalized. Furthermore, without private cars clogging the streets, traffic jams would be dramatically reduced, allowing buses and emergency vehicles to move much faster and more reliably, improving overall urban mobility.

On the other hand, a total and immediate ban would cause major **inconvenience** and hardship for many citizens if not properly planned. Those who live in the suburbs and work in the city center would struggle enormously to commute if the public transport system is not sufficiently developed, frequent, and reliable. Many suburban areas currently lack adequate bus or train connections. For families with young children, elderly members, or disabled relatives, a private car is often not a luxury but a **necessity** for medical appointments, shopping, and daily activities. Therefore, simply banning cars without first providing a **viable alternative** in the form of comprehensive public transportation would be unfair and could harm economic productivity.

In conclusion, banning private cars from city centers is an admirable long-term goal that would benefit the environment and public health. However, before implementing such a ban, the government must first invest heavily in developing a high-quality, efficient, affordable, and comprehensive public transport system to ensure that all citizens can travel easily and conveniently without their cars.
