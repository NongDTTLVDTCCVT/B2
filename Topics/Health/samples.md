## Speaking Part 1
**Q: What do you do to stay healthy?**
- **Answer:** I try to maintain a balanced diet and work out regularly.

## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** You feel stressed. How should you relax? *Play sports*, *Listen to music*, *Go shopping*.
**Choice: Play sports.**

**Sample Answer:**
"If I were feeling stressed and had to choose a way to relax among playing sports, listening to music, or going shopping, I would definitely choose **playing sports**.

First of all, physical activity is scientifically proven to reduce stress. When we exercise, our body releases endorphins, which are hormones that make us feel happy and relaxed. Playing sports also helps improve physical health, making us fitter and stronger.

On the other hand, going shopping is not a good choice for me. Although it might be fun initially, it can be very expensive. Spending money might even lead to more stress later if I run out of budget. As for listening to music, it is a good way to relax, but it is quite passive. I prefer doing something active to clear my mind completely.

Therefore, playing sports is the healthiest and most effective way to relieve stress."

## Speaking Part 3 (Full Sample Answer)
**Topic: How to improve public health?**
- Education
- Facilities
- Regulations

**Sample Answer:**
"Public health is a major concern for any society. There are three key measures that can be taken to improve the health of the community: education, facilities, and regulations.

First of all, **education** is fundamental. Schools should include nutrition and physical education in their curriculum to teach children specifically about healthy eating habits and the dangers of junk food. Raising awareness from a young age creates long-term benefits.

Secondly, the government should invest in **facilities**. Building more public parks, sports centers, and outdoor gyms provides people with free and accessible places to exercise. If these facilities are convenient, more people will use them.

Finally, stricter **regulations** are necessary. For example, imposing a tax on sugary drinks or cigarettes can discourage consumption. Banning smoking in public places also protects non-smokers from passive smoking.

In summary, a combination of education, better infrastructure, and strict laws is the key to a healthier society."

## Writing Task 1 (Full Sample Informal Letter)
**Topic:** Write a letter to a friend explaining why you haven't written for a long time (you were sick).

**Sample Letter:**
Dear John,

I am so sorry for not writing to you sooner and for being completely out of touch for the past few weeks. I feel terrible about my silence, but I have been really **under the weather** lately and simply couldn't check my emails or messages.

I caught a terrible flu about three weeks ago, just before the final exams started. It started with a high fever of 39 degrees Celsius and a **severe** headache that wouldn't go away even with painkillers. I felt so weak and dizzy that I couldn't even get out of bed for the first few days. My doctor advised me to take complete rest, drink plenty of water, and take antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. It was a really **exhausting** and frustrating experience, especially because I had to postpone my exams, which added a lot of stress.

Fortunately, I am feeling much better now and have almost fully **recovered**, although I still get tired quite easily and need to take afternoon naps. I went back to school last Monday and have been catching up on all the missed lessons and assignments.

How have you been? I hope everything is going well with you and your family. Please tell me all your news! Let's meet up for coffee next weekend when I am completely back to normal. I really miss our long conversations.

Best wishes,
[Your Name]

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Fast food is becoming popular and causing health problems. Should fast food be banned?

**Sample Essay:**
The consumption of fast food has increased dramatically in recent years worldwide, leading to a concerning rise in **obesity** and related serious health issues such as diabetes and heart disease. While some people argue that the government should ban fast food completely to protect public health, I strongly disagree with this extreme view and believe that regulation combined with education are far better and more practical solutions.

**Proponents** of a total ban argue passionately that fast food is the main culprit causing lifestyle diseases that burden healthcare systems. Fast food is typically high in sugar, salt, saturated fats, and artificial additives while being nutritionally deficient. Eliminating it entirely would theoretically force people to eat healthier home-cooked meals prepared with fresh ingredients. They claim this would dramatically reduce obesity rates, especially among children who are increasingly affected.

However, banning fast food is not a realistic or practical solution for several compelling reasons. Firstly, it seriously **infringes on** personal freedom and individual choice, which are fundamental rights in democratic societies. Adults should have the autonomy to choose what they eat, even if those choices are unhealthy. The government's role should be to inform and guide, not to control people's dietary decisions dictatorially. Secondly, the fast-food industry provides employment for millions of people globally, from restaurant workers to delivery drivers and suppliers. A sudden complete ban would cause massive unemployment and economic disruption, destroying livelihoods. Furthermore, fast food serves a practical purpose for busy workers, students, and families who genuinely do not have time to cook elaborate meals daily due to demanding schedules.

Instead of an outright ban, the government should regulate the industry much more strictly and comprehensively. For example, they could mandate that restaurants display calorie counts, sugar content, and nutritional information prominently on menus and packaging to enable informed choices. They could also require fast food chains to reduce salt and sugar content gradually, offer healthier options like salads and grilled items, and restrict advertising targeting children. Additionally, education is absolutely crucial and should be prioritized. Public health campaigns should educate citizens, especially young people, about the importance of maintaining a **balanced diet**, reading nutritional labels, cooking at home, and exercising regularly. Schools should include nutrition education in their curriculum from an early age.

In conclusion, while fast food undeniably **poses health risks** when consumed excessively, banning it completely is an extreme, impractical measure that creates more problems than it solves. I believe that through comprehensive education, reasonable regulation, and personal responsibility, we can encourage healthier choices without restricting fundamental personal freedom.
