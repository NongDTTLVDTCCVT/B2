## Speaking Part 2 (Full Sample Answer)
**Situation:** You feel stressed. How should you relax? *Play sports*, *Listen to music*, *Go shopping*.
**Choice: Play sports.**

**Sample Answer:**
“If I were feeling stressed and had to choose a way to relax among playing sports, listening to music, or going shopping, I would definitely choose **playing sports**.

First of all, physical activity is scientifically proven to reduce stress. When we exercise, our body releases endorphins, which are hormones that make us feel happy and relaxed. Playing sports also helps improve physical health, making us fitter and stronger.

On the other hand, going shopping is not a good choice for me. Although it might be fun initially, it can be very expensive. Spending money might even lead to more stress later if I run out of budget. As for listening to music, it is a good way to relax, but it is quite passive. I prefer doing something active to clear my mind completely.

Therefore, playing sports is the healthiest and most effective way to relieve stress.”

**Topic: How to improve public health?**
- Education
- Facilities

**Sample Answer:**
“Public health is a major concern for any society. There are three key measures that can be taken to improve the health of the community: education, facilities, and regulations.

First of all, **education** is fundamental. Schools should include nutrition and physical education in their curriculum to teach children specifically about healthy eating habits and the dangers of junk food. Raising awareness from a young age creates long-term benefits.

## Writing Task 2 (Full Sample Essay)
**Topic:** Fast food is becoming popular and causing health problems. Should fast food be banned?

**Sample Essay:**
The consumption of fast food has increased dramatically in recent years, leading to a rise in obesity and related health issues. While some people argue that the government should ban fast food completely, I disagree with this view and believe that regulation and education are better solutions.

Proponents of a ban argue that fast food is the main cause of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and heart problems. It is often high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Eliminating it would theoretically force peopl

### Vocabulary Analysis
- **Obesity (n):** Bệnh béo phì.
- **Proponent (n):** Người ủng hộ (Antonym: Opponent).
- **Infringe on (v):** Xâm phạm (quyền lợi, tự do).
- **Pose health risks:** Gây ra các nguy cơ về sức khỏe.
- **Balanced diet:** Chế độ ăn uống cân bằng.e to eat healthier home-cooked meals.

However, banning fast food is not a practical solution. Firstly, it infringes on personal freedom. Adults should have the right to choose what they eat. Secondly, the fast-food industry provides jobs for millions of people and contributes to the economy. A sudden ban would cause significant unemployment. Furthermore, fast food is convenient for busy workers who do not have time to cook.

Instead of a ban, the government should regulate the industry more strictly. For example, they could require restaurants to display calorie counts on menus or reduce the amount of salt in their food. Additionally, education is crucial. Public campaigns should encourage citizens to maintain a balanced diet and exercise regularly.

In conclusion, while fast food poses health risks, banning it is an extreme measure. I believe that through education and reasonable regulation, we can encourage healthier choices without restricting personal freedom.
